Describe what is taking your energy, when words are hard.

## Feature requests, bugs, or other issues 

Feedback is very welcome. Raising a GitHub issue is the best way to communicate

* Use offline (as a "progressive web app"), so it can be installed.

## Self hosting

Simply copy the `dist` folder to any webserver. No server side support needed.
