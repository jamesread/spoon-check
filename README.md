## Feature requests, bugs, or other issues 

Feedback is very welcome. Raising a GitHub issue is the best way to communicate
:-)

## Design considerations

* Accessibility is very important. 
* Use offline (as a "progressive web app"), so it can be installed.

## Self hosting

Simply copy the `dist` folder to any webserver. No server side support needed.

You can customize data/icons.json to suit your needs.

## Docker Container
